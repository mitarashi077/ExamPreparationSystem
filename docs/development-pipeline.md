# Development Pipeline Specification

## 4-Phase Automated Pipeline

This document defines the comprehensive development process that ensures consistent, high-quality software delivery through structured phases and automated workflows.

## Pipeline Overview

The development pipeline consists of four sequential phases, each with designated agents, specific deliverables, and clear completion criteria.

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

**Agent**: `requirement-analyzer`  
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes  
**Deliverable**: `docs/requirements/{{task-name}}.md`

#### Content Requirements
- **User Stories**: Clear, testable user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed specification of what the system should do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability constraints
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific logic and constraints
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes that define success

#### Process Steps
1. **Stakeholder Input**: Gather requirements from all stakeholders
2. **Analysis**: Break down high-level requirements into specific, testable criteria
3. **Validation**: Ensure requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive requirements document
5. **Approval**: Obtain stakeholder sign-off on requirements

#### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All user stories have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- [ ] No ambiguous or conflicting requirements
- [ ] Stakeholder approval documented
- [ ] Traceability matrix established

**Completion Signal**: "Requirements analysis complete. Proceeding to design phase."

### Phase 2: Technical Design

**Agent**: `technical-designer`  
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes  
**Deliverables**: 
- `docs/design/{{task-name}}.md`

5. **Sequencing**: Determine optimal task execution order
6. **Validation**: Review plan feasibility and resource availability

#### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All tasks are clearly defined and estimable
- [ ] Dependencies are mapped and critical path identified
- [ ] Resource requirements are realistic and available
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies are defined
- [ ] Timeline aligns with business requirements
- [ ] Plan is approved by development team

**Completion Signal**: "Implementation planning complete. Proceeding to execution phase."

### Phase 4: Task Execution

**Primary Agents**: Selected based on complexity and domain
- `task-executor`: Simple tasks (1-2 files, low complexity)
- `frontend-executor`: Frontend-focused tasks (React/UI)
- `backend-executor`: Backend-focused tasks (API/Database)

**Supporting Agents**:
- `task-decomposer`: Breaks down complex tasks into atomic units
- `quality-fixer`: Ensures all quality gates pass
- `git-manager`: Handles all Git operations

#### Execution Process

##### 1. Task Decomposition
**Agent**: `task-decomposer`  
**Output**: `docs/plans/tasks/{{task-id}}.md` for each atomic task

**Process**:
- Break implementation plan into atomic, independent tasks
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Define clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria
- Assign appropriate implementation agent

##### 2. Implementation
**Agent**: Implementation agent (task-executor/frontend-executor/backend-executor)

**Process**:
1. **Setup**: Create or switch to appropriate branch
2. **Implementation**: Write code following established patterns
3. **Testing**: Write and run unit/integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Self-Review**: Review own code for quality and completeness

**Atomic Commit Requirements**:
- Each commit represents one logical change
- Maximum 3 files per commit (exceptions for tightly coupled changes)
- Descriptive commit messages following conventional format
- All commits must pass basic quality checks

##### 3. Quality Assurance
**Agent**: `quality-fixer`

**6-Phase Quality Process**:
1. **Lint Check**: Code style and basic error detection
2. **Type Check**: TypeScript compilation and type safety
3. **Test Execution**: Unit and integration test suite
4. **Build Verification**: Production build compilation
5. **Security Audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
6. **Performance Check**: Core web vitals and performance metrics

**Process**:
- Run automated quality checks
- Apply automated fixes where possible
- Report any issues that require manual intervention
- Ensure all quality gates pass before proceeding

##### 4. Git Operations
**Agent**: `git-manager`

**Process**:
1. **Branch Management**: Create, switch, and clean up branches
2. **Commit Management**: Ensure atomic commits and proper messages
3. **PR Creation**: Create pull requests with comprehensive descriptions
4. **Merge Operations**: Handle merging after all approvals
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve merge conflicts when they arise

#### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All planned tasks completed successfully
- [ ] All quality gates passed (6 phases)
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression introduced
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met

**Completion Signal**: "Implementation complete. All quality gates passed. Ready for review."

## Pipeline Automation

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
name: Development Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  requirements-check:
    if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[requirements]')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Validate Requirements
        run: ./scripts/validate-requirements.sh

  design-review:
    if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[design]')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Design Validation
        run: ./scripts/validate-design.sh

  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Lint Check
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type Check
        run: npx tsc --noEmit
      - name: Test Suite
        run: npm test
      - name: Build Check
        run: npm run build
      - name: Security Audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level high
      - name: Performance Check
        run: npm run perf
```

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require linear history
- Restrict pushes to main branch

## Success Metrics

### Pipeline Efficiency
- **Phase Completion Time**: Average time per phase
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: Percentage of successful pipeline runs
- **Rework Rate**: Percentage of tasks requiring rework
- **Defect Escape Rate**: Bugs found in production vs. development

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Maintained above 80%
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Kept below 5%
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Zero high/critical in production
- **Performance Scores**: Maintain above 90 (Lighthouse)

### Delivery Metrics
- **Lead Time**: Time from requirements to production
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often we deploy to production
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Average time to fix production issues
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing issues

## Exception Handling

### Phase Failures
If any phase fails:
1. **Stop Pipeline**: Do not proceed to next phase
2. **Analyze Failure**: Identify root cause
3. **Fix Issues**: Address problems in current phase
4. **Restart**: Re-run failed phase after fixes
5. **Document**: Record lessons learned

### Emergency Bypasses
For critical production issues only:
1. **Document Justification**: Clear reason for bypass
2. **Limit Scope**: Minimum change necessary
3. **Expedited Review**: Accelerated but thorough review
4. **Post-Emergency**: Full pipeline execution after emergency
5. **Retrospective**: Analyze and improve process

---

**Enforcement**: This pipeline is mandatory for all development work. Bypasses are only allowed for documented emergencies and must be followed by proper pipeline execution.
