## ðŸš¨ Agent System Issues Analysis

### **Boundary Violations**
- **Frequency**: Low (estimated 5-10% of agent interactions)
- **Common Patterns**: 
  - quality-fixer occasionally performing minor design decisions
  - technical-designer sometimes suggesting implementation details
  - git-manager sometimes commenting on code quality
- **Impact**: Minimal workflow disruption but reduces specialization benefits

### **Selection Accuracy**
- **Correct Selections**: 85-90% (estimated based on current rules)
- **Common Misselections**:
  - Simple multi-file changes going to specialized executors
  - Complex single-file changes staying with task-executor
  - Documentation tasks sometimes misrouted
- **Optimization Needed**: 
  - Refine complexity assessment beyond file count
  - Add semantic analysis for task classification

### **Efficiency Gaps**
- **Redundant Handoffs**: 
  - requirement-analyzer â†’ technical-designer handoff sometimes duplicates work
  - Multiple quality checks across different agents
- **Missing Specializations**:
  - No dedicated mobile app specialist
  - No DevOps/infrastructure specialist
  - No security specialist (currently distributed)
- **Bottlenecks**:
  - quality-fixer becomes bottleneck in high-velocity development
  - git-manager sequential processing limits parallel development
